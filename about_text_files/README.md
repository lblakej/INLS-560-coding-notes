# Text files

_Presented in a somewhat logical progression_
## pixels: 

`the-force-screen-shot.png` 

Contains no readable characters. May be converted by Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Or you can vocalize the text into your smart phone app and use text-to-speech recognition to get a text file with characters.

VS code will present the .png file in the Code area.

## No file extension: 

`the-force` 

Perfectly okay for command line. This is considered a text file even though it does not have a `.txt` extension.  There is no requirement for extensions to view a file on LINUX systems.

## Text file (.txt):
 `the-force.txt` simple text, baically the same as the no extension file, but can be opened by apps like Microsoft Word

## Markdown: 

`the-force.md`
